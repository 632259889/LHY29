Personal data collected by us is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized online access to personal data, we maintain personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite our reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the Services, you assume this risk.</p>

	<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>Sometimes, we have some apps for all ages. We consider ourselves to be family-oriented, however, we have decided to voluntarily implement higher child protection standards even though our products and services are not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, with the sole exception of persistent identifiers as described below. If we learn that we have collected personal information other than the persistent identifier of a child under the age of 13, we will take all reasonable steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@eyewind.cc">Privacy@eyewind.cc</a>.</p>
	<p>In order to preserve the family-friendly reputation of our Apps, we age-gated some features in our Apps, so that they are not available for use by children under 13. The age gate is being conducted after the download of some of our Apps for specific territories in order to assure the privacy and protection of younger users of our Apps. The features enabling potential collection and sharing of personally identifiable information, except for persistent identifiers, are disabled for device IDs of users who did not pass the age gate. For users’ safety, it is not possible to change the age later on. We do not store the year of birth of users who have identified themselves as below the age of 13 in our Apps, but only the information that their device ID did not pass the age gate.</p>
	<p>The only personal information we collect from users who have identified themselves as below the age of 13 for the purposes of offering our services are persistent identifiers (such as device ID, IDFA, IDFV, advertising ID, IP address). Such persistent identifiers are used and shared with third parties solely for providing support for the internal operations meaning placing contextual advertisements (including frequency capping), authenticating users of or personalize the content on Apps, maintaining or analyzing the functioning of the Apps, personalize the content of the App (such as sending push notifications), to perform network communications to protect the security or integrity of the user or the App, to ensure legal or regulatory compliance.</p>
	<p>When using the persistent identifiers, we will not contact users under the age of 13, display behavioral advertising to them, nor do any user tracking or profiling. In addition, we strive that all of our advertising partners adhere to the same standards for the collection, usage and disclosure of children’s personal information as we do, but we can not be responsible if they breach the commitments they gave to us regarding the collection of information. In case of such breaches, you agree that our liability is limited to the amounts we are able to receive as indemnification for the breaches from our advertising partner. For detailed information about disclosure to third parties, please see the section How do we share your information and data to third parties of this Privacy Policy.
